Project Name: Automated File Organizer

Description: A Python automation script designed to declutter and organize computer directories instantly. This tool solves the common problem of messy "Downloads" folders by automatically scanning files and sorting them into specific sub-directories based on their file type.

Key Features:

Automated Scanning: Uses the OS module to scan directory contents in real-time.

Smart Sorting Logic: Identifies file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .pdf, .txt) and maps them to predefined categories like "Images" or "Documents."

Safe File Handling: Checks if destination folders exist before moving files; if not, it creates them dynamically.

Bulk Operations: Capable of moving hundreds of files in seconds using the Shell Utilities module.

Tech Stack: Python 3.x, os, shutil
